Use of this video content is at your own risk.\n\nMusic By: Scott & Brendo (\u201cKitten Air\u201d - Instrumental) \n\nProject Inspired By: \n\nMy 5 year old son. He pulled a piece of PVC pipe out of the garbage and asked if we could make a project with it. A blowgun was the first idea that came to mind, and quickly snowballed into a really awesome project idea!\n\nProject History & More Info:\n\nThis is an original project idea which came right out of the blue a couple of weeks ago, but is among my favorites already!\n\nThe blowgun is so simple and cheap to make, anyone can do it, and the best part is it looks completely legit, and can fire with amazing precision.\n\nWhen my 5 year old son pulled a piece of plastic pipe out of the garbage and asked if we could do a project I immediately thought of making a blow dart gun. But to make it safer for indoor use, I tried using paper for ammunition. I rolled up a post-it note, and shoved the tip of a crayon inside to add some weight.\n\nWhen we shot the dart, it flew over 100 feet away at high velocity, making me realize there is a real project here waiting to be developed.\n\nI spent the next 5 days evolving different prototypes, and experimenting with different types of homemade ammunition.\n\nI let my kids try shooting darts made with nails, but their lungs weren't powerful enough to get the darts to stick into targets, so we use marshmallows instead. The pipe is the perfect width for mini-marshmallows and can still shoot them fast enough to hurt a little, but still safe enough for indoor use.\n\nThe blowguns can be customized with different color schemes in a way that's so simple it's nearly mind blowing.\n\nMany people have asked how to make the precision laser sight. It's just a 2\" piece of the same PVC pipe, with 8 screws, as seen in the video. Simply insert the laser, and adjust the screws until the laser is pointing directly at the place where the blowgun hits the target, then make sure the screws are relatively tight so the laser doesn't move.\u00a0\n\nHave fun and good luck! It's mind-blowing to think this stuff is in our food!  Here's how to make a glowing \"magical mud\" from ordinary potatoes.\n\nBecause of the popularity of this project, I've put together a detailed 15 page PDF ( with step-by-step instructions, Fun Facts, Helpful Hints, and loaded with pictures.  I'm selling them to help compensate for my time.

It's non-toxic, and perfectly ok to eat in small quantities, however, use of video content is at own risk.\n\nMusic By:  (Dust Sucker)\n\nProject Inspired By: \n\nA pots and pans sales presentation.  They peeled some potatoes to make us dinner, and I noticed the white residue at the bottom of the dish and asked if I could take it home.\n\nProject History & More Info: \n\nWhen I realized that potatoes could be chopped up and soaked to leach out the starch, of course the first thing I thought of was making oobleck.  My mind was blown when I experimented with this process, and realized the starch would collect at the bottom of the dish, and would stay in place when the water and impurities were poured out.\n\nAfter only a couple of rinses, it's amazing to see how pure the starch powder can be.  It looks exactly like cornstarch that could be purchased at the store.\n\nI was familiar with the idea of making tonic water glow under UV light, so wondered how it would would mix with the starch powder.  The result was very gratifying! Call them Yoshi eggs, Stress-balls, or Ninja Turtle squishies.

I wasn\u2019t willing to pay $10 for a bag of 3, so I went home and played around with different methods until I figured out how to make these with balloons and flour.\n\nProject History & More Info: \n\nMy kids go crazy playing with these little toys because they are soft, squishy, and very colorful.  What\u2019s really cool about them is that we can make them together, and they don\u2019t cost very much at all.  In-fact, they end up just costing pennies a piece.\n\nThey make cool gifts for birthday parties, and I personally use them for juggling balls from time to time, because they are perfectly weighted, and have a soft and rubbery grip.

( If you check out the link, please share the love and let Marek know that Grant Thompson sent you. :)  Thank you!\n\nProject History & More Info: \n\nAfter seeing the video by Marek Hayward (which had 10,000 views at the time, and is now over 1,000,000!) I dropped everything I was doing to try this experiment.\n\nUnfortunately I couldn\u2019t get much success with it.  The rockets only seemed to work about half the time, and the needle they were launching from would get coated in carbon and tar residues after only a couple of launches, which seriously affected the performance.\n\nIn addition, the rockets weren\u2019t balanced, so once they fired, they wouldn\u2019t shoot very straight.\n\nIt\u2019s taken me over a year of prototyping and testing, and playing with different ideas to get the result you see in this video.  I developed the idea into a full-on matchbox rocket launching kit, which I\u2019m super proud of, and excited to share in the project video.\n\nThese rockets shoot consistently between 20-40 feet, and one of the biggest factors to whether the rockets work or fail, depends on how tight the crimp is on the rockets nose.  Any rocket that has failed on me has almost always been because the crimp wasn\u2019t done right, or wasn\u2019t tight enough.\n\nThe rockets will propel the furthest if they're launched from a stable base that has little to no give.  If there is any give on the launchpad, that will absorb some of the energy and the rocket won\u2019t go as far.\n\nMultiple tests in my house confirmed that if the rockets land on the carpet, they need to be moved within 1-2 seconds, or they will begin to melt into the fabric.  The aluminum casings are heated in a flame until they reach the auto-ignition temperature of the match head, so you can expect them to be very hot, and may want to be wearing gloves when you recover the spent rocket casings as well :)\n\nThis is an awesome and exciting project whether you're a kid or and adult.  It\u2019s impressive to fire a rocket with one match head and see such power, and the smoke trail it leaves in it\u2019s wake is extremely satisfying as well.\n\nI\u2019m giving away the template I made for free, all I ask in return is that you please share this video :)  You can get it here:  Check out our LIQUID METAL fidget spinner video:  \n\nBottles of Water: \nFood Coloring: \nFoil Pan: \nInflatable Duck: \n\nEndcard Links:\n\nDry-Ice Cream: \n5 Tricks With Dry Ice: \nBuying Liquid Nitrogen: \nNitrocellulose Lacquer: \n\nBusiness Inquiries: For business and sponsorship inquiries please contact us directly: \n\nSee What Else I\u2019m Up To:\n\nInstagram: \nFacebook: \nPinterest: \n\nMusic by: Johan Borjesson - \"All Of Us\"\nRoyalty Free Music from Epidemic Sound: \n\nWARNING:\n\nThis video is only for entertainment purposes.

It feels so good on the teeth to bite into it, and my kids go crazy for them .. so I spent a bit of time researching how they're made commercially.\n\nMy biggest motivation for doing this was to see if we could make our own at home, and I'm actually still trying to figure out how to make gelatin and corn syrup from scratch, so if I can figure out how to do that, maybe I'll show how to do it in another project video.\n\nOnly a small handful of you have ever seen the LEGO Gummy video I made in 2010, and that's because it was nearly 5 years ago, before I really got serious about making videos.  I took it off my channel in 2012 because I had full intentions of making a better version, so here it is .. 3 years later! :)\n\nNow I wanted to make candies that made people look twice, and LEGO bricks instantly came to mind because what's more awesome than LEGO and gummy put together?  But I wasn't sure where could you get a mold for making LEGO bricks.\n\nSurfing around the internet, I stumbled across an awesome Instructable by SFHandyman: \n\nTo my amazement, not only had he shown how to make a mold for making LEGO candy, he also made LEGO gummies as well!  \n\nI played around with loads of variations in recipes to see what texture and tastes I liked the best.  And I've kept experimenting off and on for the last 4 years, using my kids and wife for feedback.  They gobble them up no matter what variations I use, but I've finally settled on 1/2 cup of very cold water, 1/4 cup of corn syrup, 2 packets of unflavored gelatin, and 1 pack of Jell-O.  I've found that the corn syrup seems to help smooth out the texture and the taste.\n\nIf you try making this recipe, it's very important to start the gelatin in cold water.  Stir it up, then let it sit for 5 minutes before you turn on the heat.  Otherwise, you'll get gobby clumps of undissolved gelatin in your syrup that doesn't look very appetizing.  \n\nI originally made my silicone mold with a 2 part mix from a special effects supply company.  I used real LEGO bricks set on a LEGO base, and built a makeshift retaining wall with bricks and play-dough.  I don't plan to make a tutorial on how to make the mold, but I want to do a video on how to make a silicone mold in general.  It's amazing to see how much detail the silicone can transfer to the final gummy products.  If you look closely at my candies you can even see the little \u201cLEGO\u201d text on top of the gummy LEGO studs.\n\nTo make sour gummies, we often add citric acid.  They are incredible!  But if you don't have citric acid, try taking SFHandyman's suggestion and add vitamin C.  The citric and ascorbic acids in the vitamins sour them the same way, which actually makes them taste just as great, and enriches them with vitamin C as well. Gummy Chicken Reveal!

Glass bottles are not recommended, as the ice expands when freezing and can shatter the glass explosively. Use of video content is at own risk. \n\nMusic By:  (Remember The Dreams) \n\nProject Inspired By: \n\nThe viral YouTube video: \"How to Chill A Coke In just a second!!\" ( and the process of nucleation was inspired by \"Self-Freezing Coke - Crazy from Kong!\"  \n\nProject History & More Info: \n\nI knew water could be turned to instant ice ( but was amazed to see that soda could be supercooled as well.\n\nThe anomaly of \"self freezing soda\" has been observed by many people, usually by accident. Some people put a soda in the freezer to chill it, but then forget about it. When they've remembered and gone to get it, it's liquid until they open it, leaving them puzzled. Some people have noticed the effect by leaving the soda outside in cold temperatures.\n\nThere is a vending machine in Hong Kong that sells supercooled Coke bottles, and the instructions to trigger nucleation is the same as in this video, however they recommend taking a sip when the cap is on. I believe this is to increase the chances of impurities being introduced into the liquid, making nucleation more likely. \n\nFrom what I've seen, the results in this experiment form an even thicker slush than the vending machine in Hong Kong.\n\nTo get this effect, I put 4 bottles of 500mL (16.9 oz) soda in a freezer set at -24\u00baC (-11\u00baF) between 3:15- 4:00 hours. The longer they are in, the more dramatic and solid the slushy freeze will be. However, anytime after 3:15 hours there is a chance of them freezing before you take them out.\n\nEvery freezer will be a little different temperature, and I've noticed the location of your bottles in the freezer makes a dramatic difference on freeze times. For best results, choose one consistent location in your freezer, and play around with freeze times to see what works best for you. In my freezer, the middle of the center rack settles at -24\u00baC (-11\u00baF) and takes 3:15 to super chill 4 bottles.\n\nRemember that the longer the freezer door is open, the more cold air will escape, and it will make your freeze times take much longer because your freezer has to cool down again. I've also noticed that the more frozen items you have in your freezer, the faster your soda will chill. In contrast, the less items in your freezer, the longer your soda will take to cool. Bottom line is, use a consistent environment for your experiments, and you'll get consistent results!\n\nI also experimented with 2 litter bottles, and had great results between 4-5 hours. The whole bottle slushifies in an instant. \n\nI experimented with Gatorade, Fresca, Mexican Sprite, Rootbeer, Orange sodas, Coke, Diet Coke, in bottle form, as well as in cans. I had super cooled success with them all!\n\nThe trick to getting the 3 second slush, is quickly releasing the pressure in the bottle and re-securing the cap, flipping the bottle upside down, and back upright again. This is because the forming ice crystals will be moved around the length of the bottle, and trigger nucleation for the rest of the soda.\n\nIf you were to just take the cap off, ice will form, and it will slowly spread downward, but might take upwards of 2 minutes for the bottle to completely freeze.\n\nRemoving the pressure very slowly from the bottle, can keep the soda liquified, and give you the choice opportunity to play with supercooled soda outside of the bottle. If you're not a coconut cracking ninja from Samoa, then you'll need an easier way to bust coconuts for pleasure, or for survival.  This is the easiest and most effective way I've found to do it, when you don't have any tools.\n\nInspired by Tom Hanks \"Castaway\".

He pulled a piece of PVC pipe out of the garbage and asked if we could make a project with it. A blowgun was the first idea that came to mind, and quickly snowballed into a really awesome project idea!\n\nProject History & More Info:\n\nThis is an original project idea which came right out of the blue a couple of weeks ago, but is among my favorites already!\n\nThe blowgun is so simple and cheap to make, anyone can do it, and the best part is it looks completely legit, and can fire with amazing precision.\n\nWhen my 5 year old son pulled a piece of plastic pipe out of the garbage and asked if we could do a project I immediately thought of making a blow dart gun. But to make it safer for indoor use, I tried using paper for ammunition. I rolled up a post-it note, and shoved the tip of a crayon inside to add some weight.\n\nWhen we shot the dart, it flew over 100 feet away at high velocity, making me realize there is a real project here waiting to be developed.\n\nI spent the next 5 days evolving different prototypes, and experimenting with different types of homemade ammunition.\n\nI let my kids try shooting darts made with nails, but their lungs weren't powerful enough to get the darts to stick into targets, so we use marshmallows instead. The pipe is the perfect width for mini-marshmallows and can still shoot them fast enough to hurt a little, but still safe enough for indoor use.\n\nThe blowguns can be customized with different color schemes in a way that's so simple it's nearly mind blowing.\n\nMany people have asked how to make the precision laser sight. It's just a 2\" piece of the same PVC pipe, with 8 screws, as seen in the video. Simply insert the laser, and adjust the screws until the laser is pointing directly at the place where the blowgun hits the target, then make sure the screws are relatively tight so the laser doesn't move.\u00a0\n\nHave fun and good luck! It's mind-blowing to think this stuff is in our food!  Here's how to make a glowing \"magical mud\" from ordinary potatoes.\n\nBecause of the popularity of this project, I've put together a detailed 15 page PDF ( with step-by-step instructions, Fun Facts, Helpful Hints, and loaded with pictures.

They peeled some potatoes to make us dinner, and I noticed the white residue at the bottom of the dish and asked if I could take it home.\n\nProject History & More Info: \n\nWhen I realized that potatoes could be chopped up and soaked to leach out the starch, of course the first thing I thought of was making oobleck.  My mind was blown when I experimented with this process, and realized the starch would collect at the bottom of the dish, and would stay in place when the water and impurities were poured out.\n\nAfter only a couple of rinses, it's amazing to see how pure the starch powder can be.

A little Borax detergent booster, yellow and green food coloring, and a 5 oz bottle of some clear non-toxic school glue.\n\nBorax can be found as a detergent booster under the name \"20 mule team Borax\".  It's a natural mineral with a chemical formula Na2B4O7 \u2022 10H2O. The IUPAC name for borax is sodium tetraborate decahydrate. Borax also is known as sodium borate, sodium tetraborate or disodium tetraborate.\n\nIf you don't have access to Borax, I've heard that liquid starch can be used instead.  I haven't tried it, but let me know if you do, and how well it works?  Just mix 1/2 cup liquid starch (eg. Sta-Flo) with an 8oz bottle of glue (should be the whole bottle).

What\u2019s really cool about them is that we can make them together, and they don\u2019t cost very much at all.

Glass bottles are not recommended, as the ice expands when freezing and can shatter the glass explosively. Use of video content is at own risk. \n\nMusic By:  (Remember The Dreams) \n\nProject Inspired By: \n\nThe viral YouTube video: \"How to Chill A Coke In just a second!!\" ( and the process of nucleation was inspired by \"Self-Freezing Coke - Crazy from Kong!\"  \n\nProject History & More Info: \n\nI knew water could be turned to instant ice ( but was amazed to see that soda could be supercooled as well.\n\nThe anomaly of \"self freezing soda\" has been observed by many people, usually by accident. Some people put a soda in the freezer to chill it, but then forget about it. When they've remembered and gone to get it, it's liquid until they open it, leaving them puzzled. Some people have noticed the effect by leaving the soda outside in cold temperatures.\n\nThere is a vending machine in Hong Kong that sells supercooled Coke bottles, and the instructions to trigger nucleation is the same as in this video, however they recommend taking a sip when the cap is on. I believe this is to increase the chances of impurities being introduced into the liquid, making nucleation more likely. \n\nFrom what I've seen, the results in this experiment form an even thicker slush than the vending machine in Hong Kong.\n\nTo get this effect, I put 4 bottles of 500mL (16.9 oz) soda in a freezer set at -24\u00baC (-11\u00baF) between 3:15- 4:00 hours. The longer they are in, the more dramatic and solid the slushy freeze will be. However, anytime after 3:15 hours there is a chance of them freezing before you take them out.\n\nEvery freezer will be a little different temperature, and I've noticed the location of your bottles in the freezer makes a dramatic difference on freeze times. For best results, choose one consistent location in your freezer, and play around with freeze times to see what works best for you. In my freezer, the middle of the center rack settles at -24\u00baC (-11\u00baF) and takes 3:15 to super chill 4 bottles.\n\nRemember that the longer the freezer door is open, the more cold air will escape, and it will make your freeze times take much longer because your freezer has to cool down again. I've also noticed that the more frozen items you have in your freezer, the faster your soda will chill. In contrast, the less items in your freezer, the longer your soda will take to cool. Bottom line is, use a consistent environment for your experiments, and you'll get consistent results!\n\nI also experimented with 2 litter bottles, and had great results between 4-5 hours. The whole bottle slushifies in an instant. \n\nI experimented with Gatorade, Fresca, Mexican Sprite, Rootbeer, Orange sodas, Coke, Diet Coke, in bottle form, as well as in cans. I had super cooled success with them all!\n\nThe trick to getting the 3 second slush, is quickly releasing the pressure in the bottle and re-securing the cap, flipping the bottle upside down, and back upright again. This is because the forming ice crystals will be moved around the length of the bottle, and trigger nucleation for the rest of the soda.\n\nIf you were to just take the cap off, ice will form, and it will slowly spread downward, but might take upwards of 2 minutes for the bottle to completely freeze.\n\nRemoving the pressure very slowly from the bottle, can keep the soda liquified, and give you the choice opportunity to play with supercooled soda outside of the bottle.  If you're not a coconut cracking ninja from Samoa, then you'll need an easier way to bust coconuts for pleasure, or for survival.  This is the easiest and most effective way I've found to do it, when you don't have any tools.\n\nInspired by Tom Hanks \"Castaway\".

In the future I'll probably try using colored electrical tape, a bit of duck-tape, or another flexible rubber tape with more adhesion for better durability.\n\nEither way, they are super easy to fix if they come apart.  All you have to do is tape them back together! :)\n\nHave fun!

But at about 64\u00a2 per launch just for the wadding, it seems to burn a hole in your hobby rocket money instead.\n\nI understood that recovery wadding was necessary, but it amazed me at how expensive the wadding was, and made me wonder if there was a cheaper alternative.\n\nI read a few articles suggesting that items like baking soda, roach killer, washing soda, etc could all work as makeshift flame retarders, so I began experimenting with all of them.\n\nOver the course of a month, I tested various recipes of the different powders dissolved in water by themselves, and combinations of the powders mixed in water as well.  Some worked better than others, and in the end I decided just to keep it simple by sticking to baking soda.\n\nBaking soda is a common household item, and when it gets heated up, it releases CO2 gas, which suppresses fires.  \n\nI found that about 1 Teaspoon of baking soda dissolved in about \u00bc cup of room temperature water made a saturated solution, and if I soaked a paper towel in the solution and let it dry out, the treated paper wouldn't be able to catch fire anymore.\n\nI did notice that in every test I did, the paper would smolder as long as it had access to air though, so there is still some risk of a fire hazard if left to smolder in a warm dry place with combustable materials nearby.  But in all my testing, the paper didn't even scorch when the ejection charges went off.\n\nSurprisingly, when I tested a sheet of the expensive commercial recovery wadding, the whole thing went up in flames in a matter of seconds.  That blew my mind, and made me wonder what justified charging such a high premium for it.\n\nIn further experimenting, I verified that using crepe paper from the dollar store (the streamers you hang from the ceiling for parties) is extremely fire resistant as well.  Just double-check the label to make sure it's marked as fire resistant on the package.  So far it's actually been the most flame retarding wadding I've ever used.\n\nCrepe paper is extremely cheap (2 rolls for $1), but you have to use more of it to make sure your parachute is protected.\n\nIn conclusion, I feel that the baking soda and water solution is the most practical and economical option for the average hobbyist.  You can make as much rocket wadding as you want, and it pro-rates out to about 0.025 per sheet, making it about 300 times cheaper than the name brand stuff.\n\nRitchie and I have tested this wadding over and over and over again with rocket launch after rocket launch, and in every case it's held up better than the commercial wadding, and doesn't even scorch on ejection charges from Estes black powder motors, or my homemade Sugar Rockets.\n\nThe best part about using baking soda as a flame retardant, is it's completely non-toxic, edible, and bio-degradable. Convert thrift shop pot lids and PVC sprinkler parts, into an omni-directional, rocket launching blast pad.\n\nEndcard Links:\n\nMagic Mud: \nSimple Chutes: \nN64 Rocket Controller: \nMatchbox Rockets: \n\nNext Video: Simple Chutes: \nPrevious Video: Sky Balls: \n\nSee What Else I\u2019m Up To:\n\nInstagram: \nFacebook: \nPinterest: \n\nBusiness Inquiries: For business and sponsorship inquiries please contact us directly:  \n\nWARNING: \n\nThis video is only for entertainment purposes.

We needed something that would swivel 360\u00ba, and support the launch of the Randomizer.\n\nI didn't have much time to put into the creative efforts for designing a launch pad, but once again, Ritchie went home that same day and whipped up a design that I really liked, which you can see here: (\n\nHis design uses 1/2\" PVC, and originally used a paint can lid for the blast pad, which we quickly discovered didn't hold up very well to repeated blasts of rocket fuel.\n\nI still really liked the idea of using a pot lid from a thrift store as a blast pad, like I showed in the \"Redneck Rocketry\" video: ( so I kept that, and upgraded the launch frame to 3/4\" PVC as well.\n\nI slightly modified the paint job, but all-in -all this idea was heavily founded on Ritchie's idea, so big shout-out to him for giving approval to make my own version, and my own project video.\n\nYou can see the launch-pad angles to any position you could ever hope for, and is sturdy and durable enough to take a beating from multiple launches, with hardly any sign of wear.\n\nI'm really excited to have the Randomizer Blast-Pad join me as an important addition to this series on home-built rocketry.\n\nDepending on whether you already have PVC glue and spray paint, you can probably get away with making the launch pad for around $10.\n\nBy the way, I keep the launch-pad behind my workstation, so every now and then you might catch a glimpse of it in the background of random project videos.  This simple recipe is great to do with the kids, and lets you pump out massive amounts of custom gummies, that are snack-able, and stackable as well!\n\n[\u2713] Lego Ice Molds: \n[\u2713] SmoothSil Silicone: \n[\u2713] Karo Corn Syrup: \n[\u2713] Knox Gelatin: \n[\u2713] Blue Jell-O: \n\nEndcard Links:\n\nBatarang: \nClothespin Gun: \nNinja Balls: \nSoda Tab Chains: \n\nSee What Else I\u2019m Up To:\n\nInstagram: \nFacebook: \nPinterest: \n\nBusiness Inquiries: For business and sponsorship inquiries please contact us directly:  \n\nWARNING:  \n\nThis video is only for entertainment purposes.

It feels so good on the teeth to bite into it, and my kids go crazy for them .. so I spent a bit of time researching how they're made commercially.\n\nMy biggest motivation for doing this was to see if we could make our own at home, and I'm actually still trying to figure out how to make gelatin and corn syrup from scratch, so if I can figure out how to do that, maybe I'll show how to do it in another project video.\n\nOnly a small handful of you have ever seen the LEGO Gummy video I made in 2010, and that's because it was nearly 5 years ago, before I really got serious about making videos.  I took it off my channel in 2012 because I had full intentions of making a better version, so here it is .. 3 years later! :)\n\nNow I wanted to make candies that made people look twice, and LEGO bricks instantly came to mind because what's more awesome than LEGO and gummy put together?  But I wasn't sure where could you get a mold for making LEGO bricks.\n\nSurfing around the internet, I stumbled across an awesome Instructable by SFHandyman: \n\nTo my amazement, not only had he shown how to make a mold for making LEGO candy, he also made LEGO gummies as well!  \n\nI played around with loads of variations in recipes to see what texture and tastes I liked the best.  And I've kept experimenting off and on for the last 4 years, using my kids and wife for feedback.  They gobble them up no matter what variations I use, but I've finally settled on 1/2 cup of very cold water, 1/4 cup of corn syrup, 2 packets of unflavored gelatin, and 1 pack of Jell-O.  I've found that the corn syrup seems to help smooth out the texture and the taste.\n\nIf you try making this recipe, it's very important to start the gelatin in cold water.  Stir it up, then let it sit for 5 minutes before you turn on the heat.  Otherwise, you'll get gobby clumps of undissolved gelatin in your syrup that doesn't look very appetizing.  \n\nI originally made my silicone mold with a 2 part mix from a special effects supply company.  I used real LEGO bricks set on a LEGO base, and built a makeshift retaining wall with bricks and play-dough.  I don't plan to make a tutorial on how to make the mold, but I want to do a video on how to make a silicone mold in general.  It's amazing to see how much detail the silicone can transfer to the final gummy products.  If you look closely at my candies you can even see the little \u201cLEGO\u201d text on top of the gummy LEGO studs.\n\nTo make sour gummies, we often add citric acid.  They are incredible!  But if you don't have citric acid, try taking SFHandyman's suggestion and add vitamin C.  The citric and ascorbic acids in the vitamins sour them the same way, which actually makes them taste just as great, and enriches them with vitamin C as well. Take any bottle of soda, and get it to freeze on command! This \u201csuper cool\" trick works with cans of soda as well. \n\nSome quick links to a few of the materials I used:\n\n[\u2713] Coke: \n[\u2713] Quaich (little silver dish from Scotland) :\n\nTo date, I haven't seen any tutorials on exactly how to get this \"self-freezing coke\" effect, so I'm excited to release this video in response to thousands of viewer requests.\n\nCheck out the 42 second version: (QC#13 - Instant Slushy!) \n\nTry this trick with water (Waterbending In Real Life): \nDetailed Tips & Tricks for making \"Instant Ice\": \n\nEndcard Links:\n\nWaterbending: \nPower Of The Sun: \nDry-Ice Cream: \nMaking Butter: \n\nSee What Else I\u2019m Up To:\n\nInstagram: \nFacebook: \nTwitter: \n\nBusiness Inquiries: For business and sponsorship inquiries please contact us directly:  \n\nWARNING: \n\nLeaving soda in the freezer too long can result in failure of the container, and a big mess. Glass bottles are not recommended, as the ice expands when freezing and can shatter the glass explosively. Use of video content is at own risk. \n\nMusic By:  (Remember The Dreams) \n\nProject Inspired By: \n\nThe viral YouTube video: \"How to Chill A Coke In just a second!!\" ( and the process of nucleation was inspired by \"Self-Freezing Coke - Crazy from Kong!\"  \n\nProject History & More Info: \n\nI knew water could be turned to instant ice ( but was amazed to see that soda could be supercooled as well.\n\nThe anomaly of \"self freezing soda\" has been observed by many people, usually by accident. Some people put a soda in the freezer to chill it, but then forget about it. When they've remembered and gone to get it, it's liquid until they open it, leaving them puzzled. Some people have noticed the effect by leaving the soda outside in cold temperatures.\n\nThere is a vending machine in Hong Kong that sells supercooled Coke bottles, and the instructions to trigger nucleation is the same as in this video, however they recommend taking a sip when the cap is on. I believe this is to increase the chances of impurities being introduced into the liquid, making nucleation more likely. \n\nFrom what I've seen, the results in this experiment form an even thicker slush than the vending machine in Hong Kong.\n\nTo get this effect, I put 4 bottles of 500mL (16.9 oz) soda in a freezer set at -24\u00baC (-11\u00baF) between 3:15- 4:00 hours. The longer they are in, the more dramatic and solid the slushy freeze will be. However, anytime after 3:15 hours there is a chance of them freezing before you take them out.\n\nEvery freezer will be a little different temperature, and I've noticed the location of your bottles in the freezer makes a dramatic difference on freeze times. For best results, choose one consistent location in your freezer, and play around with freeze times to see what works best for you. In my freezer, the middle of the center rack settles at -24\u00baC (-11\u00baF) and takes 3:15 to super chill 4 bottles.\n\nRemember that the longer the freezer door is open, the more cold air will escape, and it will make your freeze times take much longer because your freezer has to cool down again. I've also noticed that the more frozen items you have in your freezer, the faster your soda will chill. In contrast, the less items in your freezer, the longer your soda will take to cool. Bottom line is, use a consistent environment for your experiments, and you'll get consistent results!\n\nI also experimented with 2 litter bottles, and had great results between 4-5 hours. The whole bottle slushifies in an instant. \n\nI experimented with Gatorade, Fresca, Mexican Sprite, Rootbeer, Orange sodas, Coke, Diet Coke, in bottle form, as well as in cans. I had super cooled success with them all!\n\nThe trick to getting the 3 second slush, is quickly releasing the pressure in the bottle and re-securing the cap, flipping the bottle upside down, and back upright again. This is because the forming ice crystals will be moved around the length of the bottle, and trigger nucleation for the rest of the soda.\n\nIf you were to just take the cap off, ice will form, and it will slowly spread downward, but might take upwards of 2 minutes for the bottle to completely freeze.\n\nRemoving the pressure very slowly from the bottle, can keep the soda liquified, and give you the choice opportunity to play with supercooled soda outside of the bottle. If you're not a coconut cracking ninja from Samoa, then you'll need an easier way to bust coconuts for pleasure, or for survival.  This is the easiest and most effective way I've found to do it, when you don't have any tools.\n\nInspired by Tom Hanks \"Castaway\".

They peeled some potatoes to make us dinner, and I noticed the white residue at the bottom of the dish and asked if I could take it home.\n\nProject History & More Info: \n\nWhen I realized that potatoes could be chopped up and soaked to leach out the starch, of course the first thing I thought of was making oobleck.  My mind was blown when I experimented with this process, and realized the starch would collect at the bottom of the dish, and would stay in place when the water and impurities were poured out.\n\nAfter only a couple of rinses, it's amazing to see how pure the starch powder can be.  It looks exactly like cornstarch that could be purchased at the store.\n\nI was familiar with the idea of making tonic water glow under UV light, so wondered how it would would mix with the starch powder.  The result was very gratifying! Do you have trouble falling asleep? Do you toss and turn at night? A good night\u2019s sleep is necessary for optimal health. So if you\u2019re one of the millions of people in the world who suffers from a sleep disorder or you want to fall asleep faster, watch this video to learn a trick straight from the US military. \n\nThe amount of sleep a person needs depends greatly on their age. Knowing how much you should be sleeping can help you figure out if your sleep routine works or if it needs tweaking. Babies normally sleep for most of the day (around 16 hours), teenagers require about 9 hours a day, and adults require 7 to 8 hours a day.\n\nTIMESTAMPS: \nWhat insomnia can lead to 1:44\nStep 1 2:42\nStep 2 3:07\nStep 3 3:34\nStep 4 3:43\nStep 5 4:00\nOther tips to fall asleep quickly 6:13\n\n#soundsleep #insomnia #weightgain\n\nMusic by Epidemic Sound   \n\nSUMMARY: \n- According to the American Sleep Association, 50\u201370 million US adults suffer from sleep disorders. It\u2019s estimated that around 20% of people worldwide suffer from sleep deprivation.\n- Insomnia can be common if people are under a great amount of stress, experiencing big life changes, or having emotional difficulties.\n- If you suffer from insomnia, a lack of sleep can cause hormonal imbalances, which lead to weight gain, slower reaction times, irritability, memory problems, depression, and headaches.\n- Lie face up in bed. Relax your facial muscles, including your tongue, jaw, and the muscles around your eyes. If you realize you have a frown, really focus on releasing the area in the center of your forehead.\n- Drop your shoulders as low as possible. This will also help you stretch and release the tension in your neck. Then relax your upper and lower arm on one side, and then try it with the other arm.\n- Breathe out, and relax your chest. Feel your lungs fill up with air. \n- Relax your legs. Release the tension from your thighs first, and then let the relaxation travel down to your calves. Finally, focus on your feet and ankles. \n- Now that the muscles in your body are relaxed, it\u2019s time to clear your mind completely. \n- When the pilots were trained in this exercise, they performed it sitting down on a chair. In those exercises, they put their feet flat on the floor, placed their hands on their laps, and let them go limp.\n\nSubscribe to Bright Side : \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOur Social Media:\n\nFacebook: \nInstagram: \n\n5-Minute Crafts Youtube: \n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFor more videos and articles visit:\n  How to recycle scrap metal in the backyard, with a homemade, Mini Metal Foundry.\n\nCommon materials in the Mini Metal Foundry\n\n[\u2713] Clay Graphite Crucible: \n[\u2713] Steel Pail: \n[\u2713] Plaster of Paris: \n[\u2713] 2.5 Quart Bucket: \n[\u2713] 5 Quart Big Mouth Bucket: \n[\u2713] Heat Resistant Gloves: \n[\u2713] 1-3/8\u201d Hole Saw: \n[\u2713] 3\u201d Hole Saw: \n[\u2713] 1\u201d x 12\u201d Steel Pipe: \n\nGet \"The Hobbit\"  - Win the sword: \n\nEndcard Links:\n\nMini Fire Logs: \nMatchstick Gun: \n5 Crazy Science Stunts: \nGravity Puzzle: \n\nSee What Else I\u2019m Up To:\n\nInstagram: \nFacebook: \nPinterest: \n\nBusiness Inquiries: For business and sponsorship inquiries please contact us directly:  \n\nWARNING:  Charcoal foundries can reach temperatures in excess of 1,000\u00baC, which is well above the melting point of hobbyists.

The functionality is founded on ideas I collected while searching the internet for foundry designs.\n\nBackground: \n\nFor as long as I can remember, I've been intrigued by the idea of melting metal and making things with it.  The problem has always been that it was out of reach or required really expensive equipment.\n\nIn this project I experimented with 10 different prototypes, to develop a reusable backyard foundry that melts aluminum soda cans easily and safely.  I tested different refractory recipes, different containers, different setting for blowing air, and different types of makeshift crucibles.\n\nI tried various ratios of portland cement, sand, perlite, plaster of paris, water, and even kitty litter.  For containers, I experimented with clay pots, plastic buckets, no container, cinderblocks, and a galvanized steel pail.\n\nI ended up favoring the galvanized steel pail, and a mix of 50% plaster of paris, and 50% play sand, by volume, which was inspired by a video by NightHawkInLight \"How to Make a Soup Can Forge\" \n\nDepending on where you get, or find, your materials the cost can range anywhere from $5-$25 per unit.  With the materials I used, I was able to make 2 units for under $40 ($20 each).  Even on the high end, this is probably one of the cheapest, reliable, backyard foundries that can be made.\n\nI used mine to melt soda cans, and extract the aluminum for future metal casting projects.  All the soda cans came from a local recycling depot.  I bought back 30 lbs from the depot to avoid having to drink gallons and gallons of soda.  :)  I stored the ingots in various forms, which you can see in the next video, and tried a cool technique for making a little sword by pouring liquid metal into a bucket of sand.  I'm planning to make a project video on how to do that in the near future. \n\nThanks for watching, and please share!! :) In today's video, we're taking suggestions and putting dry ice to the test in a couple extreme environments.\n\nSubscribe & \u201cRing the Bell\u201d: \n\nSee What Else I\u2019m Up To:\n\nInstagram: \nFacebook: \nPinterest: \n\nBusiness Inquiries: For sponsorship requests or business opportunities please contact me directly: \n\nMusic by: Martin Landh - \u201cLocked Out\u201d\nRoyalty Free Music from Epidemic Sound: \n\nWARNING:\n\nThis video is only for entertainment purposes.

If you check them out, please let them know that Grant Thompson sent you.  Thanks! :)  First was a \u201clost foam casting\u201d tutorial by \u201cThe Art of Weapons\u201d ( and a Rubber Band gun designed by \u201cRBGuns\u201d (  I modified the template from RBGuns to make the styrofoam mold. \n\nProject History & More Info:\n\nThe gun is solid aluminum, made from melted down soda cans.\n\nI spent over 100 hours of time, and 7 styrofoam prototypes to make this video.  About a third of the time was spent filing and sanding the gun.  Each time I poured a casting for the gun, the trigger guard wouldn\u2019t complete all the way through, so I kept making new styrofoam guns, modifying the designs slightly until it worked.  \n\nOnce I got a fairly clean casting, I put 2 days into filing down rough points, and sanding them smooth.  \n\nThe gun could use a little more work, and it\u2019s not perfect, but this experiment was mainly a proof of concept that nearly anything you can imagine can be made fairly easily with the \u201clost foam casting\u201d technique.  Overall, I really am happy with the gun though!  It weighs 556 grams, and is really quite smooth to feel.\n\nFor future projects, I plan to work more with green sand casting.  I believe it will leave a nicer finish overall and won\u2019t require as many prototypes to get it right :)  Instead of foam, wood plugs can be used to make the molds, or even real weapons for that matter.

(#ad)\n\nProject Inspired By: \n\nweBoost.com.  The weBoost staff reached out and invited me to collaborate on a video idea for their new line of weBoost products. \n\nAbout a month ago, they reached out to see whether I had ever heard about cell phone signal boosting.\n\nIt was actually a new concept to me, even though they'd been selling products like this for over a decade, under the name \u201cWilson Electronics\u201d.\n\nOur house has always had trouble with reception, so I had one of their systems installed so I could test it for myself, and measure the results before making claims on what it could do.\n\nI did a fair amount of research on how cell phone technology works in general, and different ways signals could be enhanced.  And since most people don't have any idea how phones work or where the signals come from, I thought it would be appropriate to make a video with tips and tricks that people could try out themselves, to learn and explore the invisible radio world around them.\n\nOriginally my thinking was to create a number of different projects that could be done with the weBoost system itself, or projects that related to the concepts of signal boosting.\n\nAmong these ideas were; \n- Making a mini radio you could use to broadcast your voice on your kitchen radio.\n- Building a mini audio amplifier powerful enough to drive a large 8ohm speaker.\n- Ripping the weBoost amplifier apart, and seeing how it could re-purposed for something else.\n\nIn the end I felt that a \u201cLife Hack\u201d video showing 10 tips and tricks, would be the best.\n\nI created the video to show 10 ways you could find, or create, better signals, but I also tried to design it so you'd be learning more about how the cellular system works, at the same time.  \n\nThere is a lot of education mixed in with the projects.  So in a way it's kind of like a mini training course that'll get you involved with understanding the networks you've always used, but never really been aware of.\n\nI hope you learned something new you can start using.

I got the inspiration for using seeds as eyes in this video: \n\nProject History & More Info:\n\nI remembered someone showing me how to make an apple into a swan while I was in England in 2001.  I can't remember who it was though, and I just remember that it was a nice try, and although the wings looked cool, and head and neck were terrible.\n\nI really liked the idea though, so I spent an entire day cutting up apples in different ways to see if I could make it better.\n\nI also saw a video online where someone used apple seeds to make eyes ( which was really awesome, so I tried to incorporate that in.\n\nI ended up with this method for making the apple swan, which I think really looks incredible, and we ended up putting them on display for some dinner guests we had that night.

But I stumbled across an idea that really intrigued me (  There wasn't any information at all, and I couldn't find the idea duplicated anywhere else.  Just this one picture of an apple cut like a tic-tac-toe grid rather than cut into quarters.  And another picture showing the apple wrapped with a rubber band to hold it together.\n\nLuckily, my wife always has apples on hand, so I got experimenting.\n\nFirstly, I tried cutting the apple as seen in the picture.  My overall impression was that the pieces didn't look the way I was used to seeing apple slices, but I was surprised by how much faster it was to cut them this way, and really happy to see there wasn't a pile of apple core pieces that had to be cleaned up afterward.  Just one bit of apple core that was easily discarded, or composted. \n\nNext I tried experimenting with the rubber band around the apple.  The idea is that by keeping the pieces held together with an elastic, the apple slices won't turn brown.  I tested this idea on numerous apples and found that given enough time, they all eventually go brown, but keeping the pieces together keeps them in pretty good condition for up to around 3 hours, which could be long enough to get them to work or school just in time for snacks or lunch.  In any case, keeping the slices together was far more effective then putting them in a container, or in a ziplock baggie. \n\nI have also experimented with using lemon juice on apple slices.  The idea is that the citric acid in the lemon juice prevents the fruit from oxidizing.  That is true!  In my experiments I had apple slices last up to 8.5 hours without turning brown at all.  They may have gone even longer than that, but I ate them.\n\nWhile I was starting to film this video, my wife gave me a really great suggestion.  She said, why not turn the apples upside down when you cut them?  This way they are a lot more stable because they have a bigger base to work from.  Genius!\n\nIf you're looking for more cool tricks you can do with apples, check out my video on how to make an \"Edible Apple Swan\"   Apple art is fun, easy, and available, so give it a try and see how yours turns out :)\n\nFor one final experiment, I set up a time trial to see how the traditional method of cutting apples would compare to this new method of slicing apples.  I found that the traditional (cutting into quarters, then cutting out the cores) method took 49 seconds to make 8 slices, while the new Apple Hack method took only 10 seconds for the same results!  That's 5 times faster!\n\nSo my final conclusion is that this Apple Hack is indeed 5 x faster, easier, more convenient, and saves a baggie if you use an elastic instead.  In general, it just makes a lot more sense.\n\nIt's one of those concepts that jumps out and makes you say, why haven't we always been doing this??!\n\nWatch for the full video, to see more experiments and explanations, and in the mean time start cutting your apples upside down! :) FTC Disclaimer: This video was sponsored by VW.

He pulled a piece of PVC pipe out of the garbage and asked if we could make a project with it. A blowgun was the first idea that came to mind, and quickly snowballed into a really awesome project idea!\n\nProject History & More Info:\n\nThis is an original project idea which came right out of the blue a couple of weeks ago, but is among my favorites already!\n\nThe blowgun is so simple and cheap to make, anyone can do it, and the best part is it looks completely legit, and can fire with amazing precision.\n\nWhen my 5 year old son pulled a piece of plastic pipe out of the garbage and asked if we could do a project I immediately thought of making a blow dart gun. But to make it safer for indoor use, I tried using paper for ammunition. I rolled up a post-it note, and shoved the tip of a crayon inside to add some weight.\n\nWhen we shot the dart, it flew over 100 feet away at high velocity, making me realize there is a real project here waiting to be developed.\n\nI spent the next 5 days evolving different prototypes, and experimenting with different types of homemade ammunition.\n\nI let my kids try shooting darts made with nails, but their lungs weren't powerful enough to get the darts to stick into targets, so we use marshmallows instead. The pipe is the perfect width for mini-marshmallows and can still shoot them fast enough to hurt a little, but still safe enough for indoor use.\n\nThe blowguns can be customized with different color schemes in a way that's so simple it's nearly mind blowing.\n\nMany people have asked how to make the precision laser sight. It's just a 2\" piece of the same PVC pipe, with 8 screws, as seen in the video. Simply insert the laser, and adjust the screws until the laser is pointing directly at the place where the blowgun hits the target, then make sure the screws are relatively tight so the laser doesn't move.\u00a0\n\nHave fun and good luck!

It feels so good on the teeth to bite into it, and my kids go crazy for them .. so I spent a bit of time researching how they're made commercially.\n\nMy biggest motivation for doing this was to see if we could make our own at home, and I'm actually still trying to figure out how to make gelatin and corn syrup from scratch, so if I can figure out how to do that, maybe I'll show how to do it in another project video.\n\nOnly a small handful of you have ever seen the LEGO Gummy video I made in 2010, and that's because it was nearly 5 years ago, before I really got serious about making videos.  I took it off my channel in 2012 because I had full intentions of making a better version, so here it is .. 3 years later! :)\n\nNow I wanted to make candies that made people look twice, and LEGO bricks instantly came to mind because what's more awesome than LEGO and gummy put together?  But I wasn't sure where could you get a mold for making LEGO bricks.\n\nSurfing around the internet, I stumbled across an awesome Instructable by SFHandyman: \n\nTo my amazement, not only had he shown how to make a mold for making LEGO candy, he also made LEGO gummies as well!  \n\nI played around with loads of variations in recipes to see what texture and tastes I liked the best.  And I've kept experimenting off and on for the last 4 years, using my kids and wife for feedback.  They gobble them up no matter what variations I use, but I've finally settled on 1/2 cup of very cold water, 1/4 cup of corn syrup, 2 packets of unflavored gelatin, and 1 pack of Jell-O.  I've found that the corn syrup seems to help smooth out the texture and the taste.\n\nIf you try making this recipe, it's very important to start the gelatin in cold water.  Stir it up, then let it sit for 5 minutes before you turn on the heat.  Otherwise, you'll get gobby clumps of undissolved gelatin in your syrup that doesn't look very appetizing.  \n\nI originally made my silicone mold with a 2 part mix from a special effects supply company.  I used real LEGO bricks set on a LEGO base, and built a makeshift retaining wall with bricks and play-dough.  I don't plan to make a tutorial on how to make the mold, but I want to do a video on how to make a silicone mold in general.  It's amazing to see how much detail the silicone can transfer to the final gummy products.  If you look closely at my candies you can even see the little \u201cLEGO\u201d text on top of the gummy LEGO studs.\n\nTo make sour gummies, we often add citric acid.  They are incredible!  But if you don't have citric acid, try taking SFHandyman's suggestion and add vitamin C.  The citric and ascorbic acids in the vitamins sour them the same way, which actually makes them taste just as great, and enriches them with vitamin C as well. Try AUDIBLE with a free audiobook.

The water got softer, and our bath felt like luxury and pure bliss.\n\nI decided right then and there (in the bath tub) that I was going to figure out how to make one of these amazing devices, and share it with the world.\n\nI put the idea on the shelf for awhile to focus on other projects, but my interest was reawakened one night as my family and I were watching a YouTube channel called \"What's Up Moms\".  They had a cool bath bomb video ( that inspired me to try again.\n\nI followed Brooke's instructions perfectly, changing only the color and the amount of water slightly, and to my great satisfaction, this recipe worked perfectly!  ..which meant my wife and I enjoyed another bath bomb experience that night.\n\nWith Valentines Day quickly approaching, my goal was to come up with a cool project idea that anyone could share with their partner, and be proud of.  I wanted a project that was \"King of Random Style\", but still gentle and elegant enough to make a woman happy, and genuinely excited about her gift as well.  \n\nI spent weeks experimenting with different ideas, colors, and molds, and developed ideas ranging from black Bob-ombs and round bath bombs, to sticks of TNT.\n\nUltimately I settled on a red/pink stick of dynamite, because it looks cool, and turns the water pink as it diffuses.\n\nMy wife guided me in my choices of essential oils, based on what she prefers, so the only thing left for me to figure out was how to make the wick useful.\n\nThe idea of tying a secret gift, like jewelry, to the end of the string then packing it into the bath bomb during production came to me as I was nearing the end of my prototyping.

He didn't expect I'd end up making these!\n\nProject History & More Info: \n\nThe weather has cooled off quite a bit, which has turned my interest back to keeping warm by casting metal.  \n\nThis time round I wanted to play with higher temperature metals, like brass.  So I made a trip to a local shooting range, and salvaged a whole bucket-load of spent brass casings.\n\nQuite a few people have asked whether my backyard foundry can melt brass, and I was curious myself, so I threw a few handfuls of casings into a crucible and fired them up.\n\nI tried using lump charcoal because it burns hotter and faster than briquettes, and a clay crucible purchased from the internet because it withstands heat better, and lasts longer than steel.\n\nI was impressed that the brass melted down without hesitation, and I was able to easily cast mini brass muffins the same day.\n\nA couple things worth mentioning are that the melting point of brass is around the boiling point of zinc.  I noticed this in real-life when the metal started bubbling, and shooting out white flames.  I wasn't sure what it was until I looked it up, but it was most likely zinc oxide fumes being released.\n\nZinc Oxide can be toxic in large quantities, and although it's never happened to me, claims are that it can cause metal fume fever, which gives flu like symptoms.\n\nYou should also know that brass is over 3 times heavier than aluminum, so expect the crucible to have a lot more weight to it, making it harder to handle.\n\nMy dad was visiting at the time and confirmed my thoughts about it by suggesting I try making something more practical and useful.  So I thought it would be fun to make some \"Brass Knuckle\" paperweights.\n\nI looked online at different varieties of brass knuckles, then drew my own version in photoshop, and used the \"Styro-Slicer\" and the lost-foam casting technique to make a rough pair of knuckles.\n\nI cast another pair the same way, and spent another 8 hours sanding and buffing them up to a mirror finish, then wondered how I could take them to the next level.\n\nSpikes seemed like a cool idea, inspired by a picture I saw on a google image search, so I stopped at an alternative clothing store and picked up a spiked choker collar, and repurposed the spikes for my piece of metal art.\n\nThese are not designed or intended to be used as weapons.  Possession of Brass Knuckles is illegal in most countries, (but not where I live), however I created these simply for artistic expression, and use them mainly as workshop d\u00e9cor.  (paperweights). Did you know you can make an AC arc welder using parts from your microwave?  I just finished mine, so join me in this video as we put its welding capabilities to the test!\n\nEndcard Links:\n\nArc Welder PT. 1: \nArc Welder PT. 2: \nThe Scariac:  \nThe Metal Melter: \n\nSee What Else I\u2019m Up To:\n\nInstagram: \nFacebook: \nPinterest: \n\nBusiness Inquiries: For business and sponsorship inquiries please contact us directly:  \n\nWARNING: \n\nWelding galvanized metals can release toxic zinc-oxide fumes.  Proper eye protection and ventilation are recommended.  I run the system on 240 VAC, which is metered by a power controller I built called the \"Scariac\".  It's similar to the idea of a Variac (variable auto-controller), with a few more hazards to be aware of.  The Micro-Welder itself does not have an on-off switch, and can pose a fire hazard if plugged directly into a mains power socket.  I made this to be used exclusively with the Scariac.  (Look for how to build that in another project.)  Stick welding, and/or the modification of a Microwave Oven Transformer (M.O.T), can be very dangerous and presents risk of UV radiation, shock hazards, burns, fires, fumes and a multitude of other risks.  This project should not be attempted without adult supervision and adequate training.  Misuse, or careless use, of tools or projects may result in serious injury.  Use of this video content is at your own risk.\n\nMusic By: Jason Shaw (TU-FeelsGood2B) \n\nProject Inspired By: \n\nthepaashaas \n\nProject History & More Info: \n\nThis video is the end result of 3 other project videos which will be edited and uploaded over the next couple of months.  Those videos will show how I modified the transformers, and how to control the current, but they aren't available at the moment, hence the \"Coming Soon\" on the annotations.\n\nThis project video comes after quite a bit of thinking and experimenting with different ways to modify the microwave stick welder into something that actually works, and would actually be a useful tool to have around the shop.\n\nThere are a few videos on the internet that show various people who have tried making a stick welder from a Microwave Oven Transformer.  There are even a couple of tutorials suggesting how to  do it.  However, in my experience of trying to duplicate these projects, my MOT welder either got so hot that the insulation on the wires melted and shorted it out, and/or it didn't provide enough power to strike and maintain an arc.\n\nTo date, I haven't seen a video or project where anyone actually welded anything with one of these \"so-called\" microwave welders.  The most that's been shown is to lay a bead on a piece of metal.  But this doesn't prove it can weld.  My earlier attempts could also lay a bead, but they didn't have enough heat or penetration to make anything stick.  A welder also needs a way to reliably control the amperage (which no other project does).  I saw one project where dimmer switches were used on the primary coils, however dimmer switches are only able to handle around 600 watts, and these stick welders require upwards of 2,000-3,000 watts.  In my experience, the dimmer switches fail very quickly and within a couple minutes of trying to weld.\n\nI'm happy to say that the welder in my project does work for me.  It welds 1/16\" AC rods very well, and I believe the transformer temperatures are very reasonable and sustainable for the amount of welding I plan to do as a simple hobbiest welder.\n\nTo see exactly how I built this welder, look for Part 1 and Part 2 on how to make the Microwave Stick Welder.

Glass bottles are not recommended, as the ice expands when freezing and can shatter the glass explosively. Use of video content is at own risk. \n\nMusic By:  (Remember The Dreams) \n\nProject Inspired By: \n\nThe viral YouTube video: \"How to Chill A Coke In just a second!!\" ( and the process of nucleation was inspired by \"Self-Freezing Coke - Crazy from Kong!\"  \n\nProject History & More Info: \n\nI knew water could be turned to instant ice ( but was amazed to see that soda could be supercooled as well.\n\nThe anomaly of \"self freezing soda\" has been observed by many people, usually by accident. Some people put a soda in the freezer to chill it, but then forget about it. When they've remembered and gone to get it, it's liquid until they open it, leaving them puzzled. Some people have noticed the effect by leaving the soda outside in cold temperatures.\n\nThere is a vending machine in Hong Kong that sells supercooled Coke bottles, and the instructions to trigger nucleation is the same as in this video, however they recommend taking a sip when the cap is on. I believe this is to increase the chances of impurities being introduced into the liquid, making nucleation more likely. \n\nFrom what I've seen, the results in this experiment form an even thicker slush than the vending machine in Hong Kong.\n\nTo get this effect, I put 4 bottles of 500mL (16.9 oz) soda in a freezer set at -24\u00baC (-11\u00baF) between 3:15- 4:00 hours. The longer they are in, the more dramatic and solid the slushy freeze will be. However, anytime after 3:15 hours there is a chance of them freezing before you take them out.\n\nEvery freezer will be a little different temperature, and I've noticed the location of your bottles in the freezer makes a dramatic difference on freeze times. For best results, choose one consistent location in your freezer, and play around with freeze times to see what works best for you. In my freezer, the middle of the center rack settles at -24\u00baC (-11\u00baF) and takes 3:15 to super chill 4 bottles.\n\nRemember that the longer the freezer door is open, the more cold air will escape, and it will make your freeze times take much longer because your freezer has to cool down again. I've also noticed that the more frozen items you have in your freezer, the faster your soda will chill. In contrast, the less items in your freezer, the longer your soda will take to cool. Bottom line is, use a consistent environment for your experiments, and you'll get consistent results!\n\nI also experimented with 2 litter bottles, and had great results between 4-5 hours. The whole bottle slushifies in an instant. \n\nI experimented with Gatorade, Fresca, Mexican Sprite, Rootbeer, Orange sodas, Coke, Diet Coke, in bottle form, as well as in cans. I had super cooled success with them all!\n\nThe trick to getting the 3 second slush, is quickly releasing the pressure in the bottle and re-securing the cap, flipping the bottle upside down, and back upright again. This is because the forming ice crystals will be moved around the length of the bottle, and trigger nucleation for the rest of the soda.\n\nIf you were to just take the cap off, ice will form, and it will slowly spread downward, but might take upwards of 2 minutes for the bottle to completely freeze.\n\nRemoving the pressure very slowly from the bottle, can keep the soda liquified, and give you the choice opportunity to play with supercooled soda outside of the bottle.

Lay out a square napkin, and begin by folding it up diagonally to form a triangle.\n\n2. Fold up each of the bottom corners, to meet the point at the top.  If your napkin isn't perfectly square, just do the best you can with what you have. \n\n3. Now fold the bottom point, three quarters of the way up,\n\n4. then fold it back on itself so the point is back at the bottom. \n\n5. Go ahead and flip it over\n\n6. Take one of the back edges, and fold it a third of the way in. \n\n7. The other side, folds over next and is secured by tucking the corner into the flap at the bottom. \n\n8. Flip it over one more time, and now just peel the two sides down like you're peeling a banana. \n\nOpen the base, stand it upright, and your cloth crown is finished.  \n\nThis simple fold is quick and easy, and can add a very elegant touch to your table settings.  \n\nIf you don't have any cloth napkins, try using paper napkins instead. \n\nCredits:\n\nMusic by: Jason Shaw (RP-KickedUpPumps) audionautix.com\n\nProject inspired by: A napkin folding class my wife and I took on a recent vacation cruise, hosted by Royal Caribbean.\n\nSpecial interest was given to the following websites for more ideas, and refreshing techniques;\n\n\n\n How to fold a square napkin into The \"Candle\".

Start with a square napkin, and turn it slightly so that one point is facing up. \n\n2. Now take the bottom tip, and fold it up toward the top until the two corners match.  This should form a rough triangle.\n\n3. The next step is fold the base up just a couple of inches and press it down flat. \n\n4. At this point, we can flip the whole thing over, so the triangle is pointing to the left.\n\n5. Take the bottom point and fold it up so the tip is just past the center. \n\n6. Start rolling the whole thing into a tube, starting from the bottom, and working toward the top.  When your roll is finished, you might want to push the uneven ends back into the tube, then tuck the loose end, neatly into the cuff.  This should give you a nice sturdy base to hold your napkin upright. \n\n7. To finish off, just turn one layer of the tip down.\n\n8. Then shape the the other layer to look like a flame. \n\nNow your candle looks like it's burning, with a bit of wax dripping off the top.  It's completely finished, and ready to impress. \n\nNow if you don't have cloth napkins, try making this with a paper napkin instead.  It works just as well, as long as your gentle, and are careful not to tear the paper.  \n\nCredits:\n\nMusic by: Jason Shaw (RP-KickedUpPumps) audionautix.com\n\nProject inspired by: A napkin folding class my wife and I took on a recent vacation cruise, hosted by Royal Caribbean.\n\nSpecial interest was given to the following websites for more ideas, and refreshing techniques;\n\n\n\n How to fold a square napkin into a Simple \"Silverware Pouch\".

Fold the top left corner, of the top layer, down to the opposite side.\n\n4. Go ahead and flip the whole thing over.\n\n5. Fold the right side a third of the way in.\n\n6. Then fold the left edge back over top and tuck the bottom corner, down inside the pocket on the other.\n\nWhen it's flipped right-side-up, you can see the pouch is completely finished, so just add some silverware and set it out to impress. \n\nOf course, if you don't have any cloth napkins, these folds will work just as well, with paper napkins, and plastic utensils.  \n\nCredits:\n\nMusic by Jason Shaw (RP-KickedUpPumps) audionautix.com\n\nFind me on FB: \n\nProject inspired by: A napkin folding class my wife and I took on a recent vacation cruise, hosted by Royal Caribbean.\n\nSpecial interest was given to the following websites for more ideas, and refreshing techniques;\n\n\n\n How to fold a square napkin into The \"Pyramid\".

Like unballasted high voltage electrical arcing, or instantly fatal traveling arcs.  How about improvised spot welding, or dangerously exciting metal melting, and even makeshift AC stick welders?  I feel like I made out like a bandit on this project, and these salvaged components will lay the foundation for many projects to come. You can look, but don't touch!

It will travel up the diverging spark gap, sometimes called a \"Jacob's ladder\" until the arc is so weak it breaks.\n\nThis project is dangerous and isn't of much practical use as far as I can tell, but was a way to visibly see electricity in plasma form.\n\nBecause the MOT is unballasted, you can expect the current draw to get so high that the breaker will trip every-time if allowed to continue for an extended period of time. Here is a step-by-step tutorial on how to make an 800 amp Spot Welder from common materials and for dirt cheap!

(\n\nWhile I was working on different prototypes for that exploding blowgun ammo, I got wondering about the cap-gun caps themselves, and how they exploded on impact.\n\nI spent a considerable amount of time on the internet researching, and trying to figure out what the composition of cap gun caps were.  I was very curious to learn what composition could be stable enough to sit undisturbed, indefinitely, but explode suddenly and powerfully when hit with enough force.\n\nArmstrong's Mixture is highly volatile and extremely dangerous compound in large quantities, and has been known to explode just by stirring it too aggressively.  However in small batches like cap-gun caps, it's exciting, and relatively harmless.\n\nI found a few websites, PDF's and online studies suggesting different ways to make improvised versions of the mixture using safety matches.  This method doesn't create a pure composition though, and there really isn't any way to measure exact amounts.  But in experimenting, I did figure out an easy way to make it work consistently, every time.\n\nAt this point I have a fair amount of experience with Armstrong's Mixture, and some things you need to know about it are this;\n\n- Treat it like it could explode spontaneously at any moment, and make sure you have safety precautions in place.  This way if it does, you'll be prepared for it.\n\n- Stick to very small batches, and treat it with caution and respect.  Don't use more than 1 match-head.  2 at the most!  This makes enough powder for 10 Thunder Caps, which are about 5-10 times more powerful than regular cap-gun caps in-and-of themselves.  And while the powder from only 2 matches might not seem like much ... trust me, you DON'T want it going off all at once.  \n\n- If you mix it up too aggressively, it can go off unexpectedly, and can be extremely loud, leaving your ears ringing.  It can also be set off with friction, impact, heat, and electrical sparks.  Wear ear-plugs and safety glasses at all times.  \n\nSaying all that, I've never actually had the composition go off unexpectedly, so long as I was being extremely gentle with it.  \n\nI usually keep each movement as light as a feather and typically mix it with wooden sticks, razor blades, and anything else that is convenient and expendable, so far with 100% success.  It's important to note that I always expect it to go off at any time, and am prepared in case it does.\n\nAttempts to get the mixture to go off while stirring aggressively were hit or miss.  Most of the time nothing happened.  However, every now and again, it would explode when it was least expected.   \n\nI believe the \u201cThunder Caps\u201d project to be a safe and enjoyable experience, so long as it's experimented with in very small quantities.  \n\nHowever if you try this yourself, remember that any actions and reactions you produce are at your own risk, and you are responsible for the consequences.

So I asked Ritchie if he could help me engineer a sugar rocket.\n\nMost rocket clubs won't let you fly sugar motors, except on special experimental launch days.  However, the \u201cRandomizer\u201d rocket can also be used with commercial \u201cEstes\u201d D12-3 and E9-6 black power motors.  So if you go with those, there's a good chance they'll let you fly your rocket at any club launch.\n\nThe rocket can fly over 1,000 feet high, and depending on the winds, can stay in the air for around 5 minutes while it floats back to the ground, so it's important to be super cautious where, and when, you launch to avoid doing any damage.\n\nThis video completes the rocket building series, and I'm really excited to share my passion for building and launching rockets with completely home-made equipment.  In my opinion, it's the best way to learn about how rocketry really works.

I was looking for ideas for a small sword I could make out of styrofoam and found this: (\n\nProject History & More Info:\n\nAfter I melted my first batch of soda cans into liquid aluminum, the first thing I though of making was a sai, like Rafael from the Ninja Turtles. \n\nI didn't have a mold, but I remembered seeing a technique for \"lost foam casting\" where something could be made out of styrofoam and buried in sand, then hot molten metal poured in overtop to burn away the foam, and take the shape of the object.\n\nI tried cutting the styrofoam with a knife, but it just made a mess, and the sai looked terrible.  So I made a hot wire \"Styro-Slicer\" so I could cut foam cleaner. (\n\nWith the Styro-Slicer complete, I quickly traced out the shape of a sword freehand, and tried casting it, and it turned out perfect!  Exactly as the foam looked, and I was amazed.\n\nSo I wondered if I could make a sword that looked better and more professional.  \n\nI did a Google image search for \"sword template\", and came across a picture of a playful \"Master Sword\" that was the perfect size for a small cosplay type sword.\n\nI printed out the shape, glued it to some styrofoam, and was really glad to see I could trace the paper with the hot wire foam cutter, to get a really clean and professional looking piece.\n\nThe first prototype I made wasn't originally intended to be made into a video, but made a cameo appearance at the end of my first styrofoam casting video (\n\nSince then I've wanted to make a version that was 3D and looked awesome, but it's taken a lot of time figure out how I wanted it to look.\n\nI had my friend Ritchie from Sonic Dad make a vector of the image so I could try scaling it for templates, which he very kindly did for me.  But unfortunately I didn't end up using it because I needed to create different layers to make the sword 3D.\n\nI spent 3 days in photoshop creating different designs, layers, and template prototypes, until I finally came up with a design I liked.\n\nFrom there I tested different versions of the template on foam, so I could understand how many layers were needed to get a clean cast.  (When the blade was only 1 layer thin, the metal wouldn't penetrate all the way down).  I made and cast over 12 swords to get a feel for what worked best, and what didn't.  And this design is the result of all that experimenting and prototyping.\n\nFree \"Mini Master Sword\" Template:   A homemade substance that molds like play-dough, then hardens into silicone rubber.  \n\nNow you can make anything on a budget!\n\nSee the full project video: Coming Soon!\n\nNext Video: QC#103: \u2013 Coming Soon!\nPrevious Video:  QC#101 \u2013 LEGO Candy Mold: \n\n\"Quick Clips\" are clips of random experiments in a minute or less.\n\nSee What Else I\u2019m Up To:\n\nInstagram: \nFacebook: \nPinterest: \n\nBusiness Inquiries: For business and sponsorship inquiries please contact us directly:  \n\nEndcard Links:\n\nMiracle Safe: \nReloading Primers: \nTablecloth Parachutes: \nFloating Coin: \n\nMusic by Scott & Brendo \u201cOne More Time\u201d Instrumental\niTunes: \nYouTube: www.youtube.com/scottandbrendo\n\nProject Inspired By: Mikey77's Instructable on Ooogoo: \n\nWARNING:  \n\nThis video is only for entertainment purposes.

I used real LEGO bricks set on a LEGO base, and built a makeshift retaining wall with bricks and play-dough.  \n\nI didn't plan to make a tutorial on how to make the mold, but I've been inundated with requests for the last year, so I finally did it! :)\n\nIt's amazing to see how much detail the silicone can transfer to the final gummy products.  If you look closely at my candies you can even see the little \u201cLEGO\u201d text on top of the gummy LEGO studs. A beautiful and decorative \"floating\" shelf that's multipurpose, because it hides a secret deep within.\n\n[\u2713] Magnetic Locks:  \n[\u2713] Hinges:  \n[\u2713] Motion Activated LED: \n[\u2713] Forstner Bit (1-3/8\"):  \n[\u2713] Diamond Plate Aluminum Tread: \n\nSee the full project video: \n\nNext Video: QC#101: \u2013 LEGO Candy Mold: \nPrevious Video:  QC#99 \u2013 Chocolate LEGO: \n\n\"Quick Clips\" are clips of random experiments in a minute or less.\n\nSee What Else I\u2019m Up To:\n\nInstagram: \nFacebook: \nPinterest: \n\nBusiness Inquiries: For business and sponsorship inquiries please contact us directly:  \n\nEndcard Links:\n\nBusiness Bucket: \nBrass Knuckles: \nTNT Bath Bombs: \n\"Gas Blaster\" Propane Torch: \n\nMusic by Scott & Brendo \u201cOne More Time\u201d Instrumental\niTunes: \nYouTube: www.youtube.com/scottandbrendo\n\nProject Inspired By:\n\nA video I saw floating around Facebook last year: \n\nWARNING:  \n\nThis video is only for entertainment purposes.

Until I looked at the price.\n\nI wondered if I could build something similar myself and save some money.\n\nIt took 1 full week of prototyping, and I pulled more inspiration from a website called Tactical Walls ( and came up with my own version that looks great, works awesome, and gives peace of mind when something important needs to be hidden.\n\nMy shelf uses magnetic locks to keep it closed, and as easy as it seems to open, for anyone who doesn't understand how it works, it's deceptively difficult to open, even for adults.\n\nMotion Sensor LED: \nMagnetic Locks:  Perhaps the only thing better than LEGO, is a bucket of Chocolate LEGO!

They come in all kinds of colors and I got them all.\n\nThe different colors worked perfectly for making the chocolate LEGO look authentic, and just for fun I built them into Mario and Luigi from the classic 8 bit NES video game.\n\nThe LEGO is completely edible and I love the milk chocolate personally, and could eat it all day long.  \n\nThe other colors are all based on white chocolate, so after a handful they start to make me feel a bit sick. \"Bright Pink\" dipping chocolates and a homemade silicone mold team up to parody an infamous bar of soap.\n\n2lb SmoothSil Foodgrade Silicone: \n\nSee the full project video: Coming Soon!\n\nNext Video: QC#99: \u2013 Chocolate LEGO: \nPrevious Video:  QC#97 \u2013\"TNT\" Bath Bomb: \n\n\"Quick Clips\" are clips of random experiments in a minute or less.\n\nSee What Else I\u2019m Up To:\n\nInstagram: \nFacebook: \nPinterest: \n\nBusiness Inquiries: For business and sponsorship inquiries please contact us directly:  \n\nEndcard Links: \n\nCap Darts: \nBanger Balloons: \nProto Putty: Coming Soon!\nGlycerin Soap: \n\nMusic by Scott & Brendo \u201cOne More Time\u201d Instrumental\niTunes: \nYouTube: www.youtube.com/scottandbrendo\n\nProject Inspired By: Fight Club - the movie.

Here's a technique you can use to start a fire for survival if you having nothing but a water bottle and a bright sunny day.

On that idea, I practiced until I could prove it worked, and then until I  felt like I'd mastered the technique.\n\nProject History & More Info: \n\nComputer paper with black ink is the tinder of choice for practicing this technique because anyone should have access to it, and it's fairly consistent and reliable.  \n\nThe bottle needs to be filled with water, and ideally should have no air bubbles inside.  By turning the bottle upside down and using the rounded convex part at the top, we can use a water bottle as a make-shift magnifying lens.  \n\nThe curved water refracts the sunlight, and give the ability to focus it.  The closer the rounded lens is to resembling a liquid sphere, the better it will work.  If bubbled are trapped in the bottle, they will distort the sunlight and weaken the intensity of the beam.\n\nThis technique isn't easy, and takes a lot of practice to master, so don't wait until you're in a survival situation to try it. Did you know you can start a fire with a ziploc bag, a bit of water, and the power of the sun?

It works because rapid compression heats the air in the chamber to the ignition point of tinders, such as char cloth.  The tinder can then be used to ignite kindling, and develop a flame.\n\nIt's thought that the fire piston may have inspired Rudolf Diesel in his creation of the diesel engine around 1892.\n\nI had a fire piston I made out of copper tubing, but I wanted to make one out of clear acrylic so I could actually see the ignition of the tinder.  It seemed it mystery how, or when, it actually lit, and I wanted to see.  \n\nFINDING ACRYLIC:  I used google.com to find different plastics companies in my area, and called around until I found one that sold acrylic tubing and rods to the public.  I went for a visit, and luckily they had  some lengths of scrap tubing they couldn't sell.  I asked them if I could use it for a science project, and they gave it to me for free.\n\nThe tubing I used was 1/2\" inside diameter, and the rod was 1/2\" outside diameter - clear acrylic.  \n\nThis piston was given to a subscriber, as part of a contest I held in celebration of 10,000 subscribers on my YouTube channel.  \n\nSee more information on the fire piston on Wikipedia;  Most people wouldn't think of butter as a flammable substance, but in this project they are!  We're making emergency candles that burn for hours .. using some toilet paper, and a bit of butter!  \n\nEndcard Links:\n\nEmergency Power: \nWater Pump: \nChar Cloth: \nStick Fire: \n\nSee What Else I\u2019m Up To:\n\nInstagram: \nFacebook: \nPinterest: \n\nBusiness Inquiries: For business and sponsorship inquiries please contact us directly:  \n\nWARNING: \n\nAn open flame poses a fire hazard.  Do not use near any flammable or explosive material.  Use of this video content is at your own risk.\n\nMusic By: Music by Jason Shaw (TU-ForeverBelieve) \n\nProject Inspired By: \n\nThis was an original idea.  I had been playing around with making candles with vegetable oil and was about to make a video on some ways to do that.  One night an idea popped into my head about melted butter and I wondered if that would work.\n\nProject History & More Info: \n\nTo make butter burn, we actually need to vaporize it first!\n\nA bit of rolled up toilet paper acts as a wick, and when pushed down into the center of a block of butter and ignited, we've may have created the worlds simplest candle.  \n\nThe butter below the wick begins to melt and soak up into the paper.  The heat aids the liquid butter to be released as a vapor, and it's the vapor that's flammable.\n\nI used an 8oz block of butter and cut it in half.  Each half burns for about 4 hours each, however, during the last 2 hours it seems most of the butter liquifies and your wick may need some support.  I used a paperclip to give some stability.\n\nAnother idea would be to cut the butter into 8 sections of 1oz each and make 8 candles!  Each ounce should burn for about 1 hour. Light a survival fire with your pee. If you're into survival skills and fire-making techniques, this is a great trick to know if urine trouble.\n\nEndcard Links:\n\nFire With Water: \nFire Piston: \nSolar Scorcher: \nChar Cloth: \n\nSee What Else I\u2019m Up To:\n\nInstagram: \nFacebook: \nPinterest: \n\nBusiness Inquiries: For business and sponsorship inquiries please contact us directly:  \n\nWARNING: \n\nUse of this video content is at your own risk. \n\nMusic By: Kevin Macleod (Stormfront, Stomp Dance) \n\nProject Inspired By:\n\nDual Survival - Urine Ignition  \n\nProject History & More Info: \n\nThis is a great trick to know if urine trouble. \n\nIf clear liquids can be conformed to the shape of a sphere, sunlight can be refracted through the fluid and the energy can be focused to a point. \n\nClear water is one of the best choices because it doesn't absorb any of the suns energy, so more heat is transferred to the tinder. Colored liquids, or liquids in colored bottles can still work, but energy is lost, and that could be the difference between getting tinder ignition or not.\n\nAfter making fires with various water bottles, and posting my first video on it in 2010, someone commented and said they saw a guy on Dual Survival do it with his urine. That sounded pretty amazing to me, so I looked up the link on YouTube and saw the clip.\n\nIt seemed like he had quite a bit of trouble actually getting his fire going, and I thought that if I were ever in a survival situation like that, the last thing I would want to be doing is trying for hours how to figure out how it works. It's better to be prepared beforehand.\n\nThis video comes after many experiments of playing with various techniques. I found that using plastic wrap and urine made a combination that gave great success, and within a minute or two I could have a flame! When done correctly, it works just the same as a magnifying glass. \n\nPracticing with the amount of pressure is key, because too little and you won't have a good lens. Too much, and the plastic bursts and you're soaking wet.\n\nFAQ's: \n\nQ: Why did I wrap an apple in plastic wrap?\n\nA: Of course the video is fictional, however the survival techniques portrayed are real. I wrapped my apple with plastic wrap because I've seen it done before at hotels, and I wanted to give an example of how random resources can be used as tools. If you don't wrap your apples in plastic wrap, perhaps you wrap your sandwich, or various other food items? The plastic baggie holding the celery can also be used in a very similar manner.\n\nQ: Why did I use a page from the map for tinder instead of grass or leaves? \n\nA: This liquid lens technique will light any tinder that could be lit with a magnifying glass, since that's what it is in essence. I used a piece of paper as an example because most people have access to that as a material they could practice with. I chose paper because it's easily duplicatable by anyone wanting to try. \n\nQ: Why does the urine change color just before I light the tinder? Did I cheat?\n\nA: The urine changes color mid video, and that's because when I went to re-set my camera for a different angled shot, I dropped the first sack of urine. Awkward to hold the sack, and adjust the camera on rocky terrain at the same time. I lost my urine and had to wait for another round .. which, by that point was more hydrated because of all the water I'd drank earlier, and therefore more clear in color. In either case, I have the same success igniting tinder with either liquid lens so the difference made by the color is negligible.  ",
